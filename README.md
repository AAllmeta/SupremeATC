# SupremeATC
This is my first attempt to create a autofill supreme bot.

1. clone repository 
2. have node.js installed
3. npm install in the directory 
4. to start type node main.js in the command line

This is a very rudimentary autofill bot so don't judge.
As of right now this bot isnt working.
Feel free to reach out to me to change or teach me somthing new.
